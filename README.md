As I ran Psycharm and incorrectly ran the auto-fix and compatibility functions, it caused some problems that I couldn't fix myself, which led to deleting the library and redoing it.
I didn't realise that the previous chapters were going to be uploaded to Github when I redid them, so I only uploaded them from chapter 7 onwards.
